```py
from neural_audio import NeuralAudio

client = NeuralAudio(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

client.text_to_speech.convert(
    voice_id="32dcdovdplsmcos",
    model_id="base_v1",
    text="Hello world!",
)
```

## Voice clonning

Effortlessly recreate your voice with cutting-edge AI. Instantly generate a lifelike clone and explore the possibilities of voice transformation!

```py
from neural_audio import NeuralAudio

client = NeuralAudio(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

voice = client.clone_voice(
    name="Alex",
    description="A well-known male actor in his 50s, with a touch of excitement in his tone and a subtle sense of urgency in his delivery.",
    sample="./sample_0.wav" # or ["./sample_0.wav", "./sample_1.mp3", "./sample_2.mkv"],
)
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Real-time Streaming

Let your agents have real converstions with real-time audio streams. Both inside and out.

### Output streaming
```py
from neural_audio import NeuralAudio

streaming_client = NeuralAudio.streaming_client(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

audio_stream = streaming_client.text_to_speech.convert(
    text="Hi! How may I help you?",
    voice="Adam",
    model="na_pro_v1"
)

stream(audio_stream)
```

### Input streaming

Stream text chunks into audio as it's being generated, with <1s latency. Note: if chunks don't end with space or punctuation (" ", ".", "?", "!"), the stream will wait for more text.

```py
from neural_audio import NeuralAudio

streaming_client = NeuralAudio.streaming_client(
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

def audio_stream():
    with open("live_audio_input.wav", "rb") as audio:
        while chunk := audio.read(4096): 
            yield chunk

audio_stream = streaming_client.conversation(
    audio=audio_stream(),
    voice="Adam",
    llm="gpt-4o", # OPENAI_API_KEY required
    model="na_pro_v1"
)

stream(audio_stream)
```
